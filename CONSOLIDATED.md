## GitHub Pages Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the Father Trucker website on GitHub Pages and connecting it to the custom domain (fathertrucker.ca).

### Creating a GitHub Repository

1. **Create a GitHub Account** (if you don't already have one)
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up for an account

2. **Create a New Repository**
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
   - Select "New repository"
   - Enter the repository name: `thefathertrucker.ca`
   - Add a description: "Father Trucker - Power Serve Ministries Website"

## Link Fixes

### Final Update (March 18, 2025)
After careful testing and review, we decided to completely remove all JavaScript link-fixing scripts from the website. We have:

1. Removed and archived all link-fixing JavaScript files:
   - Moved all the following scripts to a js/removed-scripts directory:
     - github-pages-fix.js
     - path-fixer.js
     - fix-broken-links.js
     - fix-domain-links.js
     - Old backup scripts
     - redirect-fix.html diagnostic page
     - update_logo_links.sh bash script

2. Cleaned up the main script.js file:
   - Removed all URL manipulation code
   - Kept only essential functionality like mobile menu handling

3. Added js/removed-scripts/ to .gitignore to exclude these from the repository

We concluded that the standard HTML relative paths work correctly both on GitHub Pages and with the custom domain. The JavaScript "fixes" were causing more problems than they were solving, and removing them has resulted in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase with proper navigation.

### Issue Summary
The website was experiencing URL issues, particularly in the prayer guides and recommended apps pages:
- Logo links were pointing to non-existent `inddadex.html` files
- Navigation was inconsistent between GitHub Pages and the main domain
- Some links were not properly using relative paths

### Solution Implemented (March 18, 2025)
1. Created a new unified `path-fixer.js` script to handle all URL-related issues
2. Replaced the problematic scripts:
   - Backed up `fix-broken-links.js` and `fix-domain-links.js` to js/backup directory
   - Created a new, more robust solution with `path-fixer.js`
3. Updated all HTML files to use the new script
4. Ensured proper relative paths are used for all navigation

### How the Fix Works
The new `path-fixer.js` script:
- Correctly handles relative paths for both GitHub Pages and the live domain
- Fixes any links that point to non-existent `inddadex.html` files
- Ensures the logo links to the main index page from any depth in the site
- Periodically checks for dynamically added content and fixes those links too

### Files Modified
1. All HTML files in the `resources/prayer-guides/` directory
2. All HTML files in the `resources/recommended-apps/` directory
3. The main `resources.html` page
4. MEMORY.md to document the changes

### Testing
After implementing these changes, check that:
- Logo links correctly go to the main index.html from any page
- Navigation between pages works properly
- No URLs redirect to non-existent pages

### Future Maintenance
If additional issues with URLs are discovered:
- Modify the `path-fixer.js` script to handle those edge cases
- Ensure any new pages added to the site include the script reference
- Test thoroughly on both GitHub Pages and the live domain

## Testing Notes

### Current State

The website has been modified to work with GitHub Pages' default URL pattern (`username.github.io/repository-name`) by:

1. Renaming the `CNAME` file to `CNAME.bak` to prevent GitHub from trying to use the custom domain
2. Removing all absolute URLs that referenced fathertrucker.ca
3. Updating all meta tags to use relative paths
4. Modifying the sitemap.xml to use relative paths
5. Adding a special JavaScript fix (`js/fix-domain-links.js`) that prevents redirection to the domain
6. Creating a mobile-specific debug page (`redirect-fix.html`) to help diagnose and fix mobile redirection issues
7. Disabling the domain-specific redirects in .htaccess

### How to Test on GitHub Pages

1. Push all files to your GitHub repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings (Settings → Pages)
   - Set the source to the main branch
   - Do NOT configure a custom domain yet
3. GitHub will provide a URL like `username.github.io/fathertrucker.ca`
4. Test all pages and navigation using this URL

### Restoring for Production

When you're ready to connect the domain and go live:

1. Rename `CNAME.bak` back to `CNAME`
2. Update the meta tags in all HTML files:
   - Find: `<meta property="og:image" content="images/logo.png">`
   - Replace with: `<meta property="og:image" content="https://fathertrucker.ca/images/logo.png">`
   - Find: `<meta property="og:url" content="">`
   - Replace with: `<meta property="og:url" content="https://fathertrucker.ca/page-name.html">` (adjust for each page)
3. Update the sitemap.xml:
   - Change all `<loc>page.html</loc>` to `<loc>https://fathertrucker.ca/page.html</loc>`
4. Remove or comment out the fix-domain-links.js script tag from all HTML files
5. Uncomment the www to non-www redirect in .htaccess
6. Configure DNS settings in GoDaddy as described in GITHUB-SETUP.md
7. In GitHub repository settings, set the custom domain to fathertrucker.ca
8. Enable HTTPS once the domain is verified

### Files Modified

The following files were modified to remove absolute URLs:

- index.html
- about.html
- resources.html
- signup.html
- privacy-policy.html
- resources/recommended-apps/index.html
- sitemap.xml
- .htaccess

New files created:

- js/fix-domain-links.js (special script to prevent domain redirection)
- redirect-fix.html (mobile debugging page to help with mobile-specific redirection issues)
- CNAME.bak (renamed from CNAME)

### Domain Configuration

Once testing is complete, follow the instructions in GITHUB-SETUP.md to properly configure the domain.
