# Link Fixes for Father Trucker Website

This document provides information about link fixes implemented on March 18, 2025, to address issues with broken links on the website when hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Summary of Issues Fixed

1. **Logo Link Issues**
   - The logo on prayer guide pages and recommended apps pages was not clickable
   - Added proper links around the logo elements to point to the main index.html

2. **Navigation Link Issues**
   - Some prayer guide pages had incorrect relative paths in navigation menus (pointing to `../../../index.html` instead of `../../index.html`)
   - Fixed all navigation links to ensure proper relative paths

3. **"inddadex.html" Issue**
   - Some links were incorrectly pointing to "inddadex.html" instead of "index.html"
   - Created a fix-broken-links.js script to automatically correct these and similar issues

## Implementation Details

### Logo Link Fixes
- Added proper `<a href="../../index.html">` elements around logo images on all sub-pages
- Made sure they have consistent styling with `text-decoration: none; color: inherit; display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 15px;`

### Fix-Broken-Links.js Script
- Added a new script to detect and fix links pointing to incorrect filenames (inddadex.html, etc.)
- Script runs both on page load and periodically to catch dynamically added links
- Implemented fixes for common misspellings of index.html

### Navigation Path Fixes
- Updated all navigation menus to use the correct number of "../" in paths
- Ensured consistency across all prayer guide and recommended app pages

## Future Link Recommendations

1. Always test website navigation on GitHub Pages before finalizing deployment
2. Use relative links with the correct number of "../" for proper path traversal
3. Consider using root-relative paths like "/index.html" when the site is fully deployed
4. Run periodic link checks to identify and fix any broken links
5. Include the fix-broken-links.js script on any new pages to prevent similar issues
