# Link Fixes for Father Trucker Website

## Final Update (March 18, 2025)
After careful testing and review, we decided to completely remove all JavaScript link-fixing scripts from the website. We have:

1. Removed and archived all link-fixing JavaScript files:
   - Moved all the following scripts to a js/removed-scripts directory:
     - github-pages-fix.js
     - path-fixer.js
     - fix-broken-links.js
     - fix-domain-links.js
     - Old backup scripts
     - redirect-fix.html diagnostic page
     - update_logo_links.sh bash script

2. Cleaned up the main script.js file:
   - Removed all URL manipulation code
   - Kept only essential functionality like mobile menu handling

3. Added js/removed-scripts/ to .gitignore to exclude these from the repository

We concluded that the standard HTML relative paths work correctly both on GitHub Pages and with the custom domain. The JavaScript "fixes" were causing more problems than they were solving, and removing them has resulted in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase with proper navigation.

## Issue Summary
The website was experiencing URL issues, particularly in the prayer guides and recommended apps pages:
- Logo links were pointing to non-existent `inddadex.html` files
- Navigation was inconsistent between GitHub Pages and the main domain
- Some links were not properly using relative paths

## Solution Implemented (March 18, 2025)
1. Created a new unified `path-fixer.js` script to handle all URL-related issues
2. Replaced the problematic scripts:
   - Backed up `fix-broken-links.js` and `fix-domain-links.js` to js/backup directory
   - Created a new, more robust solution with `path-fixer.js`
3. Updated all HTML files to use the new script
4. Ensured proper relative paths are used for all navigation

## How the Fix Works
The new `path-fixer.js` script:
- Correctly handles relative paths for both GitHub Pages and the live domain
- Fixes any links that point to non-existent `inddadex.html` files
- Ensures the logo links to the main index page from any depth in the site
- Periodically checks for dynamically added content and fixes those links too

## Files Modified
1. All HTML files in the `resources/prayer-guides/` directory
2. All HTML files in the `resources/recommended-apps/` directory
3. The main `resources.html` page
4. MEMORY.md to document the changes

## Testing
After implementing these changes, check that:
- Logo links correctly go to the main index.html from any page
- Navigation between pages works properly
- No URLs redirect to non-existent pages

## Future Maintenance
If additional issues with URLs are discovered:
- Modify the `path-fixer.js` script to handle those edge cases
- Ensure any new pages added to the site include the script reference
- Test thoroughly on both GitHub Pages and the live domain

If issues persist or you need to further refine the URL handling, contact the developer.
