Help me to remain alert and make wise decisions. Guide me in all my interactions with others today. May I represent You well in how I speak and act. I commit this day's journey to You. In Jesus' name, Amen.

            Lord of all creation, I face challenging conditions on the road before me. I ask for Your wisdom and skill as I navigate through them. Calm my anxieties and help me remain focused. I trust that You are with me in every circumstance. Give me discernment to know when to proceed and when to wait. Keep me and all travelers safe during this difficult stretch. I place my confidence in Your care. In Jesus' name, Amen.

            <strong>Prayer:</strong><br>
            Loving Father, my heart feels the distance between me and my loved ones today. I ask You to be present with them in ways I cannot be. Protect them, provide for them, and let them feel Your love. Ease this loneliness I feel and remind me of the purpose in my work. Thank You for technology that helps us stay connected despite the miles. Help me to be emotionally present even when physically absent. Strengthen the bonds of love between us, even across the distance. In Jesus' name, Amen.
